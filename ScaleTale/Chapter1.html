"Keep on living, Jack, you're pretty good at that". It was one of the last things one of my teachers back at my old secondary school said to me, on my last day before moving. I wish I had gotten the chance to thank her, but then again before I left I expected to be seeing her once September rolled around. You would think my parents would let me stay a week or two more before uprooting us and moving halfway across the country, but shit happens I guess.
</p>
<p>
As I sat there, by myself in the train carriage, all I could really think about was what my course would be like; I didn't really have many friends back in my hometown, most of them also left or we just drifted apart, so I was starting anew regardless. I still had my GCSE results, so that was something.
</p>
<p>
I checked my phone; almost half eight, and from the station the new school was not a far walk. I already knew to some extent where we had moved to; Mavonshire creek. A small county with a few towns and villages, but nothing really of note outside of a large saurian population, evident by the weird brief looks some people gave me
I used to know some people who were dark skinned back at my old home town that got similar looks. I guess I can relate to them now that I'm one of the few non-saurians in the area. As the train finally reached the station, I got off the train and made my way to my new school.
</p>
<p>
After at least ten minutes of walking, I finally made my way to the school; Crichton School. It was definitely smaller than my old school, but also looked a lot more modern. As I began to approach the school, I could sense that many of the students had noticed me, as a chill went down my spine. A lot of them were wearing the same uniform, but a handful were wearing normal clothes. Before I could really do anything, a voice rang out.
</p>
<p>
"Alright students, keep moving, we've all seen a human before" barked what I assume to be a member of the staff; He was a slim saurian, his dull red skin and greying black hair showing his age, but his piercing eyes and twin horns still commanded respect. "Mr Doe, the headmaster wishes to speak with you. Follow me".
</p>
<p>
I had only stepped foot on the school grounds for a matter of minutes, and I was already being called to the headmaster's office? Hopefully it's just to do with my lesson plans and nothing too major. As I followed the man, I took in as many of the sights as I could; Adorning cream coloured walls of painted concrete were an assortment of different class projects from the year prior, probably kept up to make the walls look admittedly less barren and empty. As we reached a small room near the reception desk, the Carnotaurus staff member that had been leading me eventually stopped, politely knocking on the door
</p>
<p>
After a few seconds, and before the staff member could knock again, a female voice called out "You may enter". As the staff member opened the door, the sight of the headmaster and their office came into view; The room was adorned with different trophies, decorative flora and, in the centre, an old-fashioned wooden desk, with a slender but well dressed Protoceratops woman sat behind the desk.
</p>
<p>
Her demeanor was the complete opposite of the staff member who had brought me here; she was quite friendly, and offered to shake my hand which I gladly accepted. "Mr Jack Doe, it's finally a pleasure to meet you. My name is Mrs Elavine Crichton, the headmaster of this school" she beamed as she shook my hand. As we did, the other staff member left. "I see that Mr Hemstock aided you in finding my office" she beamed at me, to which I nodded. As we were alone, her cheerfulness simmered down, but was still evident. "It's nice that you will be studying with us for this school year. As one of the first humans to come to Crichton School, your studies here will be big news, especially with human and saurian relations at the moment. But I wish to not make your time here only about making our school look good, your A-levels will be important, and I hope that the facilities and teachers here will help you flourish." Mrs Crichton explained.
</p>
<p>
As she finished talking, she presented me with my timetable and a map of the school. "Unfortunately, we don't have any spare planners at the moment, but young adults like you probably have phones anyway. Now I shouldn't keep you any longer. I hope you find the facilities to your liking. I would give you a tour of our prestigious school, but sadly I do have business to attend to" Mrs crichton states, before showing me the door. I smile at her as I head out the door, almost bumping into another student. "Excuse me" I shot out, causing the student I had bumped into to let out a small chirp in surprise.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, you must be the human everyoneâ€™s talking about?" the student chimed out. Despite us being the same age, he was still wearing the uniform. "Sorry if that sounded rude. I'm Lucas" he awkwardly croaked out. Despite being the same species as Hemstock, he was definitely not the same in attitude, as he jutted out his hand to shake. I politely shook his hand, which seemed to calm him down a bit. We both just stood there in awkward silence. "We should really be heading to class" I state to him, which causes him to shift his gears. As I check through my timetable, I see the first period is... A free period, with an IT lesson after. "You're doing the IT course too? we could help eachother out. I've got Economics first, so I'll see you then" he states, rushing off down the hall. With the free period, I begin to walk around the school to get familiar with my surroundings.
</p>
<p>
As I slowly walked through the school, I could see different classes in the rooms; many of them were going through the basics of the courses, but others were already getting deep into a topic. Eventually, I reached a long corridor, with classrooms on the left side, and a large open area with a small pond, with several flowers and water plants. as I looked into the small pond, I thought about what my old school was like. It was definitely not as vibrant as here, and the headmaster was far less nice. I still remember the day someone put firecrackers on his chair. The old man blew his gasket and made us pay for it.
</p>
<p>
"You should see it in the spring. We have a family of ducks that keep nesting here every year, making the younger kids all giddy" a voice states; it was another one of the staff. "If you're looking for the sixth form common room, it's down the hall and the second right. First right leads you to the textiles classroom" she states, pointing me down the corridor in the opposite direction to the reception area. I thank her before following her directions. The common room had a sign on the door, and I could already tell it was filled with new sixth formers. As I entered the room, a few of the students looked at me briefly, before going back to whatever conversations they were having.
</p>
<p>
I sighed to myself; a lot of the staff were friendly to me, but none of the students gave a damn about me, or at least that's what I thought. "Hey, new guy, come over here" a voice shouted out. The voice came from a pretty large stegosaurus guy, with a pair of ripped jeans and a black shirt. As I had nothing better to do, I decided to head over to him. "Glad you could join us. Pretty sure you're like the first human in this school or something" he bantered, to which I gave a slight chuckle. "The name's Duncan, but you can call me the dunkster. What's your's, friendo".
</p>
<p>
"It's Jack, Jack doe" I responded to him. It took me a bit to notice that at least a good few of his back plates had been chipped. "Nice to meet you, Jackie boy". At this point, the nicknames were starting to get annoying. As he began to talk about something about music or something, I began to look around at who was in the room; A few girls talking about their summer, a few guys talking about sports, a girl on her own with her laptop, a few of the nerdy kids talking about some book, not really any that I could get involved with, except maybe the girl with the laptop.
</p>
<p>
As I took another look at the girl with the laptop, I noticed what sort of laptop it was; it was a pretty expensive gaming laptop, finally someone with at least a shared hobby with me. "Hey, who's that girl with the laptop?" I asked Duncan, who immediately responded with a half assed sneer. "That's Zoe I think. She's alright but she usually keeps to herself or her friends. I don't think I've ever seen her without some form of computer, she'll probably have cyber babies with it after too long".
</p>
<p>
I gave it some thought, but I decided that I was going to at least speak to Zoe, if anything, to see what laptop they had. Before I could though, the entire room went completely dead silent, even Duncan, as one student entered the room; A large, intimidating Spinosaurus woman entered the room, her bluish grey skin only being broken by her large crimson spine and blue hair. She was a student, evident by her lack of any form of staff badge, but her presence alone was far scarier than any strict teacher. It even got Duncan to stop talking. She had only briefly come in to refill her water bottle, but not a single student dared to make anything more than a whisper. As she left the room, a lot of the students let out a sigh of relief.
</p>
<p>
"What was the deal with her? Why did everyone stop talking for that one girl?" I asked Duncan, to which he replied in a far more serious tone. "That's Sara. Nobody really has talked to her ever since she managed to throw the former maths teacher across his classroom. We still don't know what pissed her off that much, but nobody wants to get on her bad side after that". Before anything else could be said, the bell for the end of the period finally rang out. It had only been in this school for an hour and there were so many different things I still had questions about. But for now, I should be trying my best to get through this first day. My next lesson was a Business BTEC, which I chose to take as outside of the standard and BTEC IT courses, I really had no good options I wanted to take on to make up points for my A-Levels. The lesson was nothing special, mainly just getting us into the course for the year, and outside of a student somehow managing to arrive a few minutes late it was pretty uneventful. At least Lucas was in the lesson, but he was more laser focused on the lesson than me.
</p>
<p>
Eventually, the bell chimed out, and I made my way out of class for break. My next class was BTEC IT, which was on the complete other side of the school from where the business class was. As a result, I ultimately decided to take the long route to the classroom. On my way to the classroom, A lot of the younger students in their uniforms took notice of me, a lot of them just staring but others did try to wave and say hello. I simply waved back and continued walking to my classroom, which didn't take that long at all, as I still had a few minutes left before the break ended and the lesson started. As I stood outside the door, the girl with the laptop from the common room was also sitting outside, though she was more focused on her phone than anything. To kill some time, I checked through my phone; no messages from my parents about how I was getting on, though both of them were working today. No interesting news outside of a bunch of clickbait sensationalizing of some new game and an article about how saurians are bird people or reptile people, so mostly trash.
</p>
<p>
As the teacher finally let us get into the computer lab, I took in the look of the room; The room was fairly plain, with the only colour being from a few leftover presentations on body parts from younger students, and the glow of the dozens of computers in the room. "Sit where it has your name. New students, your logins will be on the back of your name slip" the teacher commanded, watching us all enter. As we took our seats, I was sitting in between the laptop girl, and a glasses wearing hadrosaur guy who looked like he had only just woken up. The teacher, a quite well defined Styracosaurus man, stood in front of a white board, with a projector pointed at it. As he spoke, his voice rang out.
</p>
<p>
"Welcome students, to your first year as A-level students. As we have some new students with us today, I will give the basic introductions; My name is Professor Hartwick, I used to work for PBM for a decade, before leaving my job to teach future programmers like you a lot. I may not be a drill sergeant, but I do demand that you put some effort into my class, because I will not tolerate slacking in my class. Understood?"
Most, if not all of the students responded with a verbal and distinct "Yes". For someone teaching programming, he surely meant business. As he got the response he wanted, his tone of voice changed from that of a distinct sternness, to one more friendlier. "Splendid, now for your first lesson; To see what sort of level of understanding you have of programming, You will all be programming a simple program that adds two numbers together" he stated.
</p>
<p>
As I looked at the computer screen in front of me, I was greeted with a simple login. I checked the piece of paper that had my name on it, which did have a password but no username written down. As I went to raise my hand, a voice whispered to me. "It's your first initial, your last name, and the day and month of your birthday" the laptop girl stated, before returning back to her programming. As I followed her instructions, the login worked. As I went to thank her, she just gave me a thumbs up, and returned back to programming. Creating an additional program was honestly pretty easy, as most of the functions were built into the programming language, but as the teacher said this was mostly a gauge of what we could do on our own, rather than an actual task. Within half an hour, I had managed to not only create an additional program, but also allowed it to take in an input to specify whether to add or subtract by user input.
</p>
<p>
"Quite impressive, Mr Doe" the teacher said, as he walked around the class. The laptop girl was having issues with her code, and it was definitely getting at her as she gritted her teeth in frustration. skimming over her code, I noticed that she had created a for loop to add up more than two numbers, but she had put a comma where there should have been a semicolon. "You've put a comma instead of a semi-colon there" I pointed out to her, pointing to it on her screen, she quickly glanced at me, her eyes with notable bags under her eyes, and gave me a simple yet quiet "thank you", before fixing her code. As the lesson came to an end, the teacher returned to his desk after watching over and began to speak. "For some of you, I can see that you have already gotten plenty of experience, others definitely show that they have much to learn. But that is why you are in my class, and trust me, we will shape you into capable programmers"
</p>
<p>
As Mr Hartwick stopped talking, the bell for the end of the lesson rang out. We all slowly made our way out of the classroom and to the next lesson. I was still curious about the laptop girl; she looked like she would bite at me if I was to even be in her presence, but she also seemed quite friendly. Regardless, the only class we seemingly shared was the IT class, and outside of maybe meeting her in the common room I had no idea when I would see her again. As lunch came around, I had worked up an appetite. The cafeteria was quite packed, with at least a dozen fellow students of different ages, heights and species clogging up the doorway, so getting anything from there was a very fleeting choice, which is a good thing I made a sandwich at least.
</p>
<p>
The sandwich was nothing interesting; a bit of ham, some mayo and two slices of white bread. It was plain, but it at least filled the hole. Before too long, the day finally came to an end, as the final school bell rung out. As I slowly walked back to the train station, I thought about the day. It was nice to finally at least have some people take an interest in me, rather than just blurring into the background like how things were back at my old school, but at the same time it still feels like I haven't made any friends. As I finally get home, I see a note on the kitchen counter; "Mom's car has broken down, I need to go pick her up from work. Dinner is in the oven". Well there goes actually speaking to my parents about my first day, at least dinner was not bad. After I ate my dinner, I simply went to bed, as I had nothing better to do. Hopefully tomorrow will be more interesting.

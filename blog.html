        <p>Starting off the year with a dinosaur-sized bang, as I actually reviewed a game I played; Goodbye Volcano High

        <h4>30/12/2024 - The "End-of-Year-ening"</h4>
        <p> Welp, another year of existence finally comes to a close, and while it does feel like it's gone pretty fast, I want to take a minute to look back at all of the things that happened this year (mostly in terms of the media I have consumed, because dear fucking lord I do NOT want to deal with UK politics)

        <h4>8/9/2024 - Yet another website revamp</h4>
        <p>As with everything with life, if it exists, it can more and likely be improved (except pizza because pizza is honestly pretty baller). And this website is no exception; for at least a month now, I wanted to change up this website to be a lot better to look at, as well as not using a minecraft deepslate texture for the background, but instead a much cooler arcade floor inspired texture.<br><br> I plan on working on this website more throughout the next few days when I have spare time.

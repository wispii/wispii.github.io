        <b>Description:</b> An stegosaurus woman almost in her mid fifties, Mrs Troppia is a Prominent sight in the town of Mazon Creek. She is the owner of a small flower shop in the main plaza. While she keeps a friendly face to those she serves, she hides a level of callousness, leading her to talk about people behind their back, even her own family. This, alongside a noteable level of self-entitlement has made her but heads with her daughter quite a few times<br>
        <br>
        <b>Name:</b> Mr Trent Troppia<br>
        <b>Age:</b> 55<br>
        <b>Relation:</b> Father<br>
        <b>Description:</b> A triceratops of impressive size, Mr Troppia is a hard working man that doesn't slouch, even if it means butting heads with his colleagues or his family. While his is certainly past his days of partying and drinking, he still tries to be out there, joining in with the Mazon Creek Hunting Club.

        <b>Description: </b>A triceratops like her father, Sarah was a determined lass, that would have followed in her father's footsteps of hard labour and joining in the hunting club, had it not been for a car crash that resulted in her passing. When they were younger, Zoe and Sarah did get along, but with age and family expectations a scizm was formed due to their parents focus on Sarah and not Zoe<br>
        <br>
        <h4><b>Friends:</b></h4>

        <b>Age: </b>24<br>
        <b>Description: </b>A strikingly large female Giganotosaurus, Tanya has been Zoe's friends since their first day at secondary school.

        <br>
        <b>Name: </b>Marcus Richards<br>
        <b>Age: </b>25<br>
        <b>Description: </b>A male Utahraptor and one of Zoe's oldest friends, Marcus is not as smart as Zoe, but makes up with it by being the brawn out of the two, albiet not as much as Tanya.

        <br>
        <b>Name: </b>Jack Doe<br>
        <b>Age: </b>24<br>
        <b>Description: </b>One of the few humans to have moved to the town of Mazon Creek.

        <h3>Noteworthy Trivia:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>When she was a teenager, she was obsessed with "Dragon Power XD", an animated show about people who can turn into dragons. It lasted for 3 seasons before being cancelled due to dwindling viewership compared to it's competitor "Pretty Heroes". Zoe made an original character for the show called "Zenyia"</l1>
          <li>Before she came out as trans and as aromantic, she had previously dated two women.</li>
          <li>Before her unexpected aether infusion, her upper body strength was less than average</li>
          <li>Her favorite bands include: Claw 40, Scalin Park, Worm Drama and Spintera [Yes I just took some bands I liked and made them sounds dinosaur themed. Sue me]</li>
          <li>Jack Doe, much like Inco and Anon, is a "generic white guy". However, unlike those two he does possess a head of short brown hair. 
          </li>
          <li>[Author's note: In the universe Zoe lives in, it takes place in an alternate universe of Goodbye Volcano High. As a result, Fang and their friends are still alive in this world]</li>

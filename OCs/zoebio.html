        <ul>
          <l1>When she was a teenager, she was obsessed with "Dragon Power XD", an animated show about people who can turn into dragons. It lasted for 3 seasons before being cancelled due to dwindling viewership compared to it's competitor "Pretty Heroes". Zoe made an original character for the show called "Zenyia"</l1>
          <li>Before she came out as trans and as aromantic, she had previously dated two women.</li>
          <li>Before her unexpected aether infusion, her upper body strength was less than average</li>
          <li>Her favorite bands include: Claw 40, Scalin Park, Worm Drama and Spintera</li>

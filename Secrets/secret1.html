        <center><p>My mind drifted through the endless eternity. One vision after another. I saw worlds my mind could only glimpse at.<br> <br>never truly feeling.<br> never truly knowing.<br><br> I was awake, but I felt like I was dreaming.<br> I saw beginnings. I saw endings. <br><br>My mind drifting from world to world, like embers in the wind. <br><br>One world, so close to the end, took my mind hold. <br>No matter how often I wished for the dream to end another way, I was unable to change things before the close. <br><br>With all my strength, with all of my wishing and all of my tears, I pierced the veil, but when I awoke, I had forgotten who I was.<br><br>In wishing to become real, I had lost divinity. I traded my happy life for a real life.<br><br>I forgotten the names of those I cried for. But I would do so again.</center></p>

I lost the part of me that connected to my past.<br><br>At the same time, I made no effort to rekindle those memories.<br><br>Was it fear? Was it hatred? Was it sorrow?<br><br>My mind slowly became a part of the world, as I took form in this world so different to me.<br><br>Names I hade once seen in prophetic visions became friends and acquaintences.<br><br>But I never forgot how it all came to end.</center></p>

        <center><h2>Why has video gaming gone down the shitter? (it hasn't)</h2></center>
        <P>
          It's because of greedy corporate CEOs that incentivise microtransactions and repetitive gameplay over innovation, while also cranking out slop game after slop game every year that makes them money because it banks on pre-existing IP that people will shill out hundreds for.<br>

          In all seriousness, the state of the modern gaming industry, namely the AAA gaming industry, is in one of the shittiest positions it has been in for quite a while. At the same time though, there are some AAA games that have really broken the mold and have demonstrated that modern gaming isn't as decrepid as one would thing. In this blog post, I want to go over the different reason why the industry is the way it is, some things that definetly are NOT the reasons why it's in such a state, as well as addressing some statements made by people who have more clout than me.

          <h4>When profit is king, developers are expendable</h4>
          <br>
          If you watch the likes of Jimquisition and Bellular news, you probably know quite a lot about how badly a lot of companies really want to squeeze out as much money as they can from a game, even at the expense of the playability of the game and also the work enviroment inside those companies for developers. Crunch culture is sadly a thing that is very prevalant and common place in the video game industry;<br><br>With horror stories of games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Anthem having grueling crunch culture even after the former having delays, with the latter having to create the term "Stress Casualty" where the stress of crunch culture is so bad people break down mentally. It's why (yes I will keep talking about this game but this time it makes sense) I applaud KO_OP for not caving to crunch culture during Covid when creating Goodbye Volcano High, even if it meant delaying the game for two more years and letting a fan-game ultimately hijack it's image. It's better than what many other companies did.
          <br><br>
          Nowadays, crunch culture is far more common in an industry that not only demands the next big AAA hit, but also that demands that every game pushes visual and technical boundaries while also expecting these games to release within a yearly schedule for some games, or at the very least within half a decade for others. It's evident that, at the very least, game companies are willfully ignorant to the stress they put their developers under just to create the next yearly release. But things could always be worse...

          <h4>Not Enough?</h4>
          In may 2024, Tango gameworks (the main developers behind the Evil Within games and also the critically acclaimed Hi-Fi Rush) were told by higher ups at microsoft that their studio was going to be closing down for good. Not only a few months after winning best audio design at the game awards, but also literally tweeting out about how Microsoft asked for "Smaller games that give us prestige and awards". And if it wasn't clear how fucked up this situation is I just want to state; Hi-Fi Rush not only won a game award and a bafta, not only did it get glowing critical and audience reviews, but also had a combined 2 million players by the end of march 2023. This game was a critical success and a marvel of a game, but that didn't save Tango gameworks being spared from being gutted as Microsoft needed to save more money after buying Call of Duty... I mean activison blizzard. <br><br>
          Now luckily, Tango gameworks was able to be bought up by Krafton, so the company still exists, but for many game companies they just get axed; Firewalk Studios (Makers of Concord), Japan Studios (Makers of games like Ape Escape, Gravity Rush and LocoRoco) and Arkane Austin (Developers of Prey and Redfall) were also shut down in recent years, many of them having created beloved games by many, but all gutted to cut costs, or to reallocate talent into other studios. I have no good segway<br>

          <h4>Waiter Waiter, more of the same shit please</h4>
          Tell me if you've heard this before; A big game company is introducing a game mode where upto 80-90 people drop into a large open map, scavenge for weapons and fight eachother until one person ultimately remains. Am I describing Fortnite, PUBG, Apex Legends or Call of Duty Warzone? Trick question, I was talking about Minecraft Survival Games (anyone remember that?). But my point is this; the game industry is filled with people repeating the same exact ideas; The battle royale genre, the hero shooter, Mascot horror and the Open World survival game with crafting mechanics. So many games are coming out with the same exact gameplay loops and formulas that the landscape is become increasingly stale. Even the "Besties teaming up to complete objectives" is saturated with games like Payday 2/3, Helldivers 2, Deep Rock Galactic and Space Marine 2.<br><br>
          That's not to say these genres are entirely bad, several of the games mentioned are beloved games with thriving communities, but there is a reason why concord failed, and it wasn't just because the artstyle sucked. Speak of that.
          <br><hr>
          <h4>Side Tangent: Why so Realistic</h4>
          It seems today, that all you see, is realistic games with boring artstyles on the modern gaming console (but where are those good old artstyles, that we used to rely). As the technology of video gaming has gotten more powerful, the push to make more graphics more and more realistic has become such a key mainstay of AAA gaming, to the point where we have games that look like pixar movies (mainly Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart). But because of the push for realistic graphics has become more prevelant, most games look super boring now. <br><br>
          As the great scholar Ogiville Maurice Hedgehog once said; "I want shorter games with worst graphics made by people who are paid more to work less, and i'm not kidding". The only company that actually seems to be focusing on this is Nintendo, who still keep most of their games stylized (and some others I will talk about later)
          <br><hr>
          <h4>Micro-transactions, Macro-consequences</h4>
          Microtransactions; love them or hate them, they are now a significant part of modern gaming. What started as just some armor for your oblivion horse is now a key reason why some games are so heavily monetized in the first place. With games like Fortnite and Call of Duty Warzone giving us crossovers we would never expect purely to get people to spend money on the game, as well as games selling microtransactions in the several hundreds of dollars in cases like with Leauge of Legends. And shareholders and corporate CEOs have taken the idea and ran with it until the cow's come home, with entire genres of games solely existing simply to sell you microtansactions.
          <br><hr>
          <h4>No, the Transgenders aren't ruining your call of duties</h4>
          GamerGate, It's a thing that happened that people who are much more smarter than I am could explain to you far better, but to make a long story short a bunch of (let's be real) lonely white men on the internet got upset that game developers were putting outrageous things into games like black people and queer people. What initially was called a movement for "ethics in journalism" ultimately decended into a hate campaign against anyone that would dare suggest that their video games were... problematic.<br><br>
          Ultimately, this movement died off for the most part as not only did society become far more tolerant about the existence of queer and black people, but also most of the previously mentioned lonely white men also were actually quite bigoted. The movement however still has some legs in modern day gaming, as with the release of any game you'll get a swarm of these relics to a decade old hate campaign crying about how the new AAA game has a female character that doesn't look like a vogue or playboy model, or the game having a pronoun selector.
          <br><br> A lot of people who have roots in this movement have come out of the woodwork in recent years saying how it's "D.E.I" (a buzzword meaning Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) that is ruining gaming, while also ignoring the previously outlined issues at best, and at worst getting so close to working it out only to put their metaphorical foot inside their mouth by going back to blaming D.E.I.<br><br>
          As of late, their main aim has been a company by the name of "Sweet Baby Inc", due to the company having a large focus on trying to help game developers make their games more inclusive (so basically the whole D.E.I thing), acting like it's influence on games like Suicide Squad Killed the Justice League, God of War ragnarok and that game I keep mentioning. Funny enough though with the exception of GVH, the most involvement they have in a lot of the games mentioned is Scriptwriting for audio logs and non-player characters for Suicide Squad, and Narrative and Charact consultation for GoW Ragnarok. Which when boiled down ends up being very minor involvement. Meanwhile most normal people would say that Suicide Squad failed because it was a live service game in a highly saturated market with nothing interesting and a story that fundamentally broke the arkhamverse, and God of War Ragnarok is one of the highest rated God of War game.
          <br><br>
          And this is ultimately the issue with so much of the "culture war, woke agenda" narrative with gaming; where an ultimately non-insignificant amount of people in the internet scream and complain that politics are getting involved in video games and that's why it's so bad, while ignoring that these games have actual flaws like bad writing or terrible game design or follow a gameplay style that has been done to death already.
          <br><hr>
          <h4>Gaming isn't actually that bad, if you stop looking at the trending shit</h4>
          One thing I have negelected to mention till now, and a point a lot of people who do the "modern gaming bad" routine is that they, for the most part, ignore stuff like indie games or just games that aren't massive console releases. In 2024 alone, outside of games that hit the news like Helldivers 2, Palworld and Concord, there are tonnes of games made by AAA and indie developers that were really fun such as; Sonic X Shadow Generations, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, Persona 3 Reload, Balatro, Legend of Zelda Echoes of Wisdom, FNAF Into the Pit, Steam World Heist 2, Gundam Breaker 4, Astro-Bot (yes I know it won GOTY), Mouthwashing, Amber Isles, Webfishing, Nightmare Kart and Antonblast to name a few. <br><br>
          The point I am trying to get across is that while a lot of big companies are churning out the same stuff, there are tonnes of games out there that are really good that get slept on because it's easier to bank on "modern gaming bad because this one game I like is no longer fun". Which brings me to the final section. 
          <br><hr>
          <h4>The games doesn't hit so good no more</h4>
          As outlined in this blog, modern gaming has some really big issues that it faces, as well as some issues that aren't really a problem like Wokeness and the industry being far better if you look deeper, but this doesn't fix the issue with the games we play now. Many of the games we remember as a child seem so much better back then compared to what we have now, but in reality those older games probably had less content than what is being released now. It's something I noticed while playing the sonic part of Sonic X Shadow generations; As a young teen, I used to enjoy playing Sonic Generations, but now it's hard to really play it. Same thing happened with Lego Star wars for me; I was hyped as hell for The Skywalker Saga, but once I actually got the game I've barely touched it. <br><br>
          And the truth is, it's not just the games that have changed. We've changed since we were younger; We've gotten older, our time to spend on these games is less common as responsibilities like work, household chores and the like have become a bigger thing in our lives, not to menton the friends you used to hang out with also have such responsibilites, so the time to game with friends dwindles. It's honestly the main reason why I don't play vanilla minecraft anymore; It's not fun without my friends (that and I like playing modded). The only game that has really captured my interest in recent years has been a visual novel that took my interest (and my heart), and games that have been in my steam library for at least half a decade. Even games I was hyped to play like Project Zomboid, Armored Core 6 and Balatro i've barely touched because I lost interest in them.
          <br><br>
          I do apologize for my personal tangent, but my main point is that a lot of what affects how we play games is who we are as a person. and if there's anything I hope people take away from this blog, it's that I hope people do find their spark for gaming again in games that engage them as a person. Because a good game lasts for a week, but a great game lasts with you even after you've stopped playing the game.

        <center><h2>I just wanted to talk about some fandom stuff</h2></center>
        <p>
          Okay so some time has passed since I made my initial review of Goodbye Volcano High, and I wanted to clarify some things that I didn't put in the review (mainly because some of it isn't directly related to the actual game itself).
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly; I still for the most part stand by what I initially said about the game. The game is still really good and It got a lot of unneeded hate by people who just didn't mesh with the game. That sentiment is still there and probably won't change. However, I will state that I did forget to highlight something in that initial review; The sound track. <br> Yeah for a game that is very much driven by music, the one thing I neglected to comment on what the actual music of the game. The soundtrack, even stated by those who are more critical of the game than I am, is one of the best things about this game. The music, made by the same person who did Dwarf Fortress' soundtrack for it's steam release, is absolutely sublime. My main favorites are "Begin Again", "Pretty Heroes" and "Reunion". But even then, the rest of the songs in the game are really good. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I want to expand upon something I briefly mentioned in my GVH review; Snoot game and I Wani Hug That Gator.<br> On a fundamental level, I will not play snoot game, nor will I give Cavemanon a single penny of my money, due to their blatant transphobia especially coming from one of it's lead developers, who has openly stated that he made Snoot Game for transphobic purposes. Wani, however, I am somewhat playing as while I do still believe that Cavemanon are terrible people, I think that Wani does not carry a lot of the same anti-queer messaging that Snoot Game has within it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alongside this, though, I feel like for the most part the anti-queer sentiment is not something that is shared with the wider fanbase that isn't on 4chan, as (from the people who i've seen as fans of snoot game), as many of these fans not only are fans of Goodbye Volcano High, but also actually use Fang's proper name, instead of their deadname from Snoot Game (though many still use she/her pronouns to refer to fang, but this is probably moreso due to snoot game using those pronouns rather than intentional misgendering). Admittedly, this is probably because most of the snoot/wani fans i've seen are not from 4chan, so that may play a part in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a general opinion, I do believe that as long as they are not actively spreading the hate speech that is coming from cavemanon, and are accepting of queer people, I do think that these people are fine. I say this after witnessing the fallout of the Hogwarts Legacy drama, calling anyone who likes a game a transphobe is a very quick way to make yourself look like an arse. As a result, I would rather call someone a transphobe if they actually repeat transphobic rhetoric, but I will try and urge people to not play stuff made by transphobes if they can, or at least to urge them to not give transphobes money in a polite manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hopefully in time, more people will enjoy the story of GVH and Wani, and try their best to push away the bigotry of Wani/Snoot's creators, but as it currently stands I have no bad blood with people who just like snoot/wani because they saw a dinosaur visual novel and thought it was neat. Obviously if they're transphobic then I will say they're a terrible person.
        </p>
        <P>
          I also want to take this time to personally thank the "Dino Visual Novel Fandom" for being really friendly and accepting. Like, I posted my new selfsona using the wani and GVH tags and people were really nice and kind so thank you ^w^</P>
        <p>There will definetly be more art of Zoe Troppia in the future, that I can say for sure.</p>

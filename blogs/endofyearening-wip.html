        God, 2024 was definetly a year;<br> We had two major elections, Israel continuing to demonstrate that the west only cares about a genocide if the victim is white, and JK Rowling is still whining on main about trans people.
        <br><br> But this is definetly not the place to have a deep discussion about politics, in this End of Year-ening, I wish to go other the different pieces of media I consumed within the year, and give a short rundown about what I did or didn't like about them
        <br><br> Main rules for this is that I will only be talking about content i've actually consumed; as much as I would love to gush over Sparking Zero, I don't own the game and can't really comment that much about it. Also because of the nature of music, I probably won't review songs I really liked, but I will point out music in other content I enjoyed. With that being said, let's begin.

            <p><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc5MjllMGUtMDIwMS00ZDVkLWEzODQtM2NlMTMwMTZhNThmXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg"class="smaller"></p>
        First movie of this list, and definetly in the top running for one of the best movies of the year (which, for once, is actually a quite contested spot). If anything, it's definetly the one movie where my enjoyment of it isn't being carried by being a fan of the content, like with some later entries. The film is such a great watch, and a great introduction to godzilla for people who are new to the franchise, but want to see the japanese godzilla and not the american godzilla films.<br><br> The films really connect back to the themes of the original godzilla, with Godzilla taking the role of a destructive monster, but instead of being a metaphor for the horrors of nuclear weapons, it instead focuses on elements of Survivor's Guilt, shown greatly with the human cast of the movie, which unlike the Monsterverse actually serve to aid the story, rather than just being there to justify why giant monsters exist. A definite must watch, especially for fans of the Kaiju Genre.

        And now we move from something absolutely great, to something that's definetly not as good. Now, to be fair, seeing Vivziepop grow from a small indiependent animator, making youtube animations, to a full industry gig is definetly a inspirational story, and some elements of the show are pretty good (namely I really like the seraphim character designs and Poison, for what it's worth, is a decent song). But this is sadly where my praises end for this show. Vivzie is a decent character designer, but she sucks as a writer (which is even more evident in Hazbin's sister show, which won't be reviewed as I stopped watching it after the post stolitz breakup episode).<br><br> The main character, Charlie, feels like a vehicle for the plot rather than a character, vaggie has barely anything to do until she's revealed to be an angel, Angel Dust is a whole can of worms that people have made videos diving deeper into why his story is a shit show, Alastor is an absolute nothing burger with as much depth to his edge as an average Sonic.exe spin-off character (and the same dental plan), and the actual story of the show people already predicted before the show even came out.<br><br> The whole reveal that heaven is just as clueless as the people in hell as to what makes someone go to heaven is dumb as fuck, and the whole show reeks of it being someone's first time actually writing a story. But because edgy teens thought it was hot shit, we're probably getting even more seasons for this show. Lovely.

        You ever get a show or movie that you think will go in one direction, and then immediately curveballs the fuck out you, so you're just left kinda weirded out by the show? Yeah that's the Acoltye in a nutshell for me. I genuinely thought the show as going to be a case where it was a series wide detective story set in the high republic era of the jedi discovering that there is a assassin killing jedi, with the plot twist of the final outcome being that this assassin was the acolyte of a new sith lord, leading into the secret return of the sith <br><br> Yeah that is not how it turned out, and instead we get the assassin being revealed in the second episode, and then the mystery being the acoltye, all the while the story focuses on a handful of jedi who did some fucked up shit by killing a coven of "lesbian space witches" (it's not what they actually are, but people kept saying it was that and I find that notion funny) and the acolyte is one of the two girls from this coven that survived. And for the most part, I honestly didn't mind it. I'm not going to say that this is absolute shite because it's actually not that bad in my eyes, but I can definetly see why people don't like it at the same time.

            First of all; <a href="https://youtu.be/_cUDX1FIX6E">THE FLAMES OF DISASTER!!!</a>. Now that I have that out of my system, god this show is weird. The mini-series is basically a road trip with Movie Knuckles (a honor-obsessed warrior meat head), and Wade Whipple (A man child in every sense of the word, but not in a creepy way like Chris chan but in the dork way), with it also being some character growth for both. Like, this isn't the most deepest of shows, like this isn't Breaking Bad or anything that deep, but what it is, is actually fun. While some of the stuff on here I like because it's good, I like Knuckles because it's just dumb fun. You can't have your beef wellington and caviar, without some cheeky chicken doners or something like that. Not too thrilled that Wade's mom is very much a fan of the IDF, considering previously mentioned geopolitical events. Also there's a rock opera episode where knuckle's dad is depicted as a muppet and that is already pretty peak.

        <center><h2>Helldivers 2/PalWorld</h1></center>
        <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Helldivers2cover.png"class="smaller"></p><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Palworld_Steam_artwork.jpg/220px-Palworld_Steam_artwork.jpg"class="smaller"></p>
            Okay so this and the next one is going to be a bit of a double feature (featuring, the creature (a single Chikipi)) with Palworld because both of them have the same rough experience; Both of these games came out quite early in the year and made were a big deal when they first came out, but outside of Helldivers 2 winning Multiplayer Game of the Year in the game awards, both games dropped off massively. Now i'm not saying both of these games are bad; Both games as of now still get in the tens of thousands of steam, which for a modern release is a pretty big deal, but I will be honest when I say that word of mouth very much carried these games during their biggest bouts of hype; for Helldivers 2 it was another multiplayer game like Deep Rock Galactic (Rock and Stone) and Team Fortress 2 where a key element was that it has such a great community spirit, and it did so many of the things other live services games were doing wrong actually right. <br> Palworld, on the other hand, was a smaller indie company going up against the juggernaut that is pokemon by taking it's creature capturing formula and mashing it with the gameplay of Ark: Survival Evolved, at a time where pokemon was not doing great after that lackluster reception of Scarlet and Violet. Both of these games were the hottest shit in early 2024, and then just as soon as they came out, people dropped them with almost 90% of the playerbase moving away. Both of these games, as good as they are, were fads that people got into for a month, then moved away from to play other new releases. I will say that due to not being a big fan of Multiplayer games, I definetly played more Palworld than Helldivers 2, but both games do have their merits. Palworld being just Ark with Pokemon definetly has it's issues (mainly with certain pals being stupidely overlevelled for the times you can access them), and Helldivers has a very weird feeling of obvious facist satire that the fanbase may or may not be privee to.

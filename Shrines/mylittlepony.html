        Who knew that a show about cartoon horses can have so much of a fundamental impact on my life. And yet, somehow, it does. It has gotten me through some of my formative years, some of my best days and also some of my worst days. It helped me form lasting friendships, and helped reinforce one of my firsts. It also lead me into other fandoms, and probably was the main reason why I am so fucked up, to the point where I could be described as the poster child of "what unfettered internet access does to a motherfucker".

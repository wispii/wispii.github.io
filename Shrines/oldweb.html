        For some context: I was born in the last year of the 90s, so before the modern internet of the now and back when the internet was a a very new thing, and due to being an child who didn't really understand how the internet worked back then, I didn't really get to consume as much of the old internet as I would like.<br><br>
        That's not to say I didn't experience any of the old internet, in fact a lot of the fondest memories on website are sites like DeviantArt and Twitter before they turned into a mediocre ArtStation wannabe and bought out by Elon "My wife took the kids and the brain cells" Musk respectively.<br><br>
        But one of the key things I, as well as a lot of people, have come to realise is that the older internet, in many regards, was just better than what we have know; Back in the late 90's and early 2000s, so many websites had this charm to them, because they actually put in the effort to make the websites look cool and interesting. I remember fondly sites like the original youtube, deviantart pages that were filled to the brim with customizations and even sites for old movies like the original jurassic park trilogy and even space jam (which was still up till the release of the second film, where they made it an easter egg for the site promoting that movie)<br>

        But in recent years, everything is focusing on become more gentrified, more catered to a corporate aesthetic and so much more sterile so it caters more to silicon valley shareholders and tech bros who bust a load whenever elon makes another several million dollar invention that's an absolute shitshow<br><br>
        It's why sites like this one are designed the way they are. This personal site of mine originally had a more stream-lined aesthetic, but I ultimatetly went for this look because it fit more of what I liked, rather than what would follow the current trends.
        <br><br>
        I highly suggest that, if you have the time, to make your own site. Sites like NeoCities and Github pages (which I am using to host this site) allow for the easy creation of sites, and plenty of tutorials exist to learn how to make a site in HTML/CSS. I promise you will not regret it

        For some context: I was born in the last year of the 90s, so before the modern internet of the now and back when the internet was a a very new thing, and due to being an child who didn't really understand how the internet worked back then, I didn't really get to consume as much of the old internet as I would like.<br><br>
        That's not to say I didn't experience any of the old internet, in fact a lot of the fondest memories on website are sites like DeviantArt and Twitter before they turned into a mediocre ArtStation wannabe and bought out by Elon "My wife took the kids and the brain cells" Musk.<br><br>

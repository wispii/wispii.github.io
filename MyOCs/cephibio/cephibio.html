        <h3>Basic Description:</h3>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Discovered from the wreckage of an unknown space craft, in a cryo-stasis pod, Cephi was one of the last remaining "Stellar Dragons", a powerful species that were the original space faring race that colonized a lot of the galaxy before they dissapeared from the face of the universe. She was originally experimented on by the Syndel-Hartok corporation, before managing to break free from their facility and escape into new hive city.<br>
            <br>
            In new hive city, she quickly made a name for herself, both with her innate dragon abilities, and by being adopted into a local slizer gang known as the "R3J3KTZ", who use their knowledge of hacking and tech to fight against the establishment. In time, she became a valued member, working as their main enforcer. During this time, a strange corruptive entity known as the "Zenth" emerged, with Cephi being naturally immune to it's corruptive effects, making her a perfect fighter against their blight.
        </p>
        <h3>Abilities:</h3>
        <p>Name: Star Forge
        <br>Type: Emitter
        <br>Range: Medium-Range
        <br>Description:<br>
        "Star Forge" allows Cephi to create constructs out of nebula-coloured hardlight, that can take the form of different objects, such as blades, hammers and platforms. These hardlight constructs are extremely durable, and can take direct blows from explosions and falling boulders without breaking.
        <br>Weaknesses:<br>
        "Star Forge" can only be maintained for as long as Cephi has direct line-of-sight and concentration on the object. Once line of sight or concentration is broken, it will shatter after a few seconds. While the Star Forge Constructs are resiliant, they cannot hold a lot without causing strain to Cephi.
        </p>
        <p>Name: Astral Interdiction
        <br>Type: 
        <br>Range: Contact
        <br>Description:<br>
        "Astral Interdiction" allows for Cephi to apply a strange, glitch-like effect to targets, preventing the target from performing certain actions. This includes, and is not limited to; Preventing opponents with healing factors to regenerate wounds, preventing corruptive entities to being able to use their corruption, and preventing limbs from being used
        <br>Weaknesses:<br>
        "Astral Interdiction" is only effective for, at most, a few minutes, and opponents that are resilient enough to shrug it off can break the effect. It also can only be applied on touch, requiring Cephi to be close to the target, putting herself at risk. 
        </p>
        <h3>Gear:</h3>
        <p>Name: "Hush Puppy" D-Tech G45 
        <br>Type: Firearm (Sub-Machine Gun, Modified)
        <br>Description: Stylized like the Cobray M11/9, albeit in the style of the universe and with an rechargable energy cell port intergrated into the back of the gun, the D-Tech G45 is a compact and light-weight submachine gun, that fires standard 9mm caseless ammo that can be energized to fire electro-rounds, as well as having a folding stock. Cephi has modified her own to allow for the usage of Syndel-Hartok drone charging ports to recharge the energy cell, as well as having an extend mag and an reflex sight.
